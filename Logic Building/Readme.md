Day 1: Building Logic and Solving Problems
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Logic Programming:It is the Collection of well defined activities to be performed in order to solve a problem.

1.Algorithms
	Pseudocode (English Language)
		-Outline of a program
		-Initialization
    -Assignment 
    -Operation
    -Relationship
    
	Pictorial Diagrams (Flow Charts)
		-graphical representation of 
		-the sequence of operations in a program
	
  Example:
 	
	Step 1: Start the program
	Step 2: Input l, b
			l=100, b=110
	Step 3: Var area
			area:= l * b
	Step 4: Print area
	step 5: End
			
Algorithm:
----------
-set of well defined instructions in sequence to solve the real life problem

Qualities of a good Algorithm:
------------------------------
  -definite
  
  -clarity
  
  -unambiguous
  
  -efficient
  
  -Simple & convinient
